## Credits

In order to create a responsive page with CSS flexbox, I used *[this resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#background)* from W3 Schools and the *[CSS Flexbox](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design#css-flexbox)* section of freeCodeCamp.org. To create a color scheme I used the app "Sip" to grab specific colors out of the banner picture.
